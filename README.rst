About

**Note:** meanwhile I am working on an alternative program named ntobjx_. Please
check it out. It has almost reached the same level of functionality as this one
(as of end of March 2016).

This repository contains the original work Marcel van Brakel and I did in 2005
for an article in The Delphi Magazine. The actual article was published in TDM
03/2006; in the same year The Delphi Magazine was discontinued.

The tool, of which you can find a code-signed version in the download_ section,
mimics to some extent the tool named WinObj from Sysinternals (now Microsoft).

The major limitation in this version is that we do not allow you to see object
properties and object security like the original does. On the other hand our
version allows you to enumerate mailslots and pipes.
